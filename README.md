# Box-Shooter-Fun
Unity 3d project that I started as the final project in a course on Unity 3d from Coursera.

There are two scenes - Level1 and Level2 - that are linked by a Beat Level event. The first level is a bit dull and is basically step-by-step recreation of what was presented in lectures.

Controls are simple: SPACE bar to shoot, mouse to move the cross-hairs. You have a timer that starts at 15 seconds and counts down in real time and a score. Some targets increase your score, some decrease it and some increase your time.

Have FUN! Design and add more levels!
